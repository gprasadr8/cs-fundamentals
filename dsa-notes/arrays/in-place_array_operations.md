# In-Place Array Operations Introduction
In-place Array operations help to reduce space complexity, and so are a class of techniques that pretty much everybody encounters regularly in interviews.

#### what are in-place array operations?
- It is this technique of working directly in the input Array, and not creating a new Array, that we call in-place.
- It means input array has been overwritten
- In-place Array operations are a big deal for programming interviews, where there is a big focus on minimising both time and space complexity of algorithms.

**Note:**
- All in-place examples are implemented as part of [ArrayInPlaceOperationsExamples.java]()
