# Conclusion:
Array-related Techniques
Report Issue
There are more array-related data structures or techniques you might want to know. We will not go deeper into most of the concepts in this card but provide the links to the corresponding card in this article.

1. There are some other data structures which are similar to the array but have some different properties:

   - [String](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/array-and-string/203/introduction-to-string/) (has been introduced in this card)
   - [Hash Table](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/hash-table/)
   - [Linked List](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/linked-list/)
   - [Queue](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/queue-stack/228/first-in-first-out-data-structure/)
   - [Stack](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/queue-stack/230/usage-stack/)
2. As we mentioned, we can call the built-in function to sort an array. But it is useful to understand the principle of some widely-used sorting algorithms and their complexity.

3. [Binary search](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/binary-search/) is also an important technique used to search a specific element in a sorted array.

4. We have introduced two-pointer technique in this chapter. It is not easy to use this technique flexibly. This technique can also be used to solve:

    - [Slow-pointer and fast-pointer problem in Linked List](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/linked-list/214/linked-list-two-pointer/)
    - Sliding Window Problem
5. The two-pointer technique sometimes will relate to Greedy Algorithm which helps us design our pointers' movement strategy.

We will come up with more cards to introduce these techniques mentioned above and update the link in the near future.
