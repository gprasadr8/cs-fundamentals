# Dynamic Array

- An array has a fixed capacity.
- We need to specify the size of the array when we initialize it. 
- Sometimes this will be somewhat inconvenient and wasteful.
- Therefore, most programming languages offer built-in dynamic array which is still a random access list data structure but with variable size.
- For example, we have vector in C++ and ArrayList in Java.
