# Linked List:

- Linked List is a linear data structure used for storing collections of data.
- Each element in the linked list is actually a separate object while all the objects are linked together by the reference field in each element.
- Successive elements are connected by pointers
- The first element of the linked list is called as **head** node.
- The last element points to **NULL**
- No fixed size, can grow or shrink in size during execution of the program
- Can create list as long as required(until system memory exhausts)
- Doesn't waste memory space(but takes some extra memory for pointers)

#### Linked List Operations:

- insertion of the element (at the begining, middle, end)
- Delection of the element (at the begining,middle,end)
- Delete complete list
- Traversing the list
- Find length of the Linked List
- Find nth node

#### Types of Linked List:

1. Singly Linked List
2. Doubly Linked List
3. Circular Linked List
4. Unrolled Linked List
5. Skip Lists
