### Linked List:

Linked List is a data structure used for storing collections of data.

- Successive elements are connected by pointers
- The last element points to NULL
- No fixed size, can grow or shrink in size during execution of the program
- Can create list as long as required(until system memory exhausts)
- Doesn't waste memory space(but takes some extra memory for pointers)

#### Linked List Operations:

- insertion of the element (at the begining, middle, end)
- Delection of the element (at the begining,middle,end)
- Delete complete list
- Traversing the list
- Find length of the Linked List
- Find nth node

#### Types of Linked List:

1. Singly Linked List
2. Doubly Linked List
3. Circular Linked List
4. Unrolled Linked List
5. Skip Lists
