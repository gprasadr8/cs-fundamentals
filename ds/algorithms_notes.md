Algorithms
--
- Algorithm is a step by step procedure for solving a computational problem.
- Program is also a step by step procedure for solving a problem, but algorithm is written during design whereas program is the real implementation of algorithm.

Characteristics of an algorithm
--
- An algorihtm take one or more inputs.
- An algorithm must generate one or more outputs.
- Every statement should be definite or un-ambiguous.
- An algorithm must terminate after finite set of steps. Don't write something that runs indefinitely.
- An algorithm must be effective. Write steps that related to solution, don't write unnecessary steps.

Analysis an algorithm
--
- Time (time taken to execute an algorithm. Write a time function w.r.to input size say n)
- Space(memory taken to execute an algorithm. write a space function w.r.to input size say n)
- Network(How much data is transferred over network)
- Power(How much power is consumed for executing an algorithm)
- CPU registers(If we write algorithm for system level design or device drive this also needs to analysed)
